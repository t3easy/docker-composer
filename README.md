# t3easy/composer

Sometimes you need a Docker image with Composer and a certain PHP minor version.

Available versions:
* Composer: 1, 2
* PHP: 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 8.0, 8.1, 8.2
* Alpine: Depending on versions used by the official PHP image.

As not all combinations are possible, please have a look at the available image tags.
E.g. `ghcr.io/t3easy/composer:2-php8.2-alpine3.17`.

If you need another version combination, feel free to open an issue.
